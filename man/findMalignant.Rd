\arguments{
\item{cna}{a matrix of gene rows by cell columns containing CNA values.}

\item{refCells}{a character vector or list of character vectors denoting the cell IDs of the known non-malignant 'Reference' cells (usually those that were used in the call to infercna::infercna to correct the CNA values). This is relevant only if these cells are in the CNA matrix. Default: NULL}

\item{samples}{a character vector of unique sample names to group the cells by. This is relevant only if multiple tumours are represented in the cna matrix, as it allows tumour-specific average CNA profiles to be computed in the call to infercna::cnaCor. See Details section for more information. Default: scalop::unique_sample_names(colnames(cna))}

\item{gene.quantile}{calculate CNA measures including only top / "hotspot" genes according to their squared CNA values across all cells. Value between 0 and 1 denoting the quantile of genes to include. Default: 0.9}

\item{gene.quantile.for.corr}{as above but for CNA correlations specifically. Default: gene.quantile}

\item{gene.quantile.for.signal}{as above but for CNA signal specifically. Default: gene.quantile}

\item{use.bootstraps}{logical; if TRUE, the function uses a bootstrapping method to subsample values and identify the malignant and non-malignant groups iteratively. This method is more sensitive to differing group sizes, so will be useful if you believe one group to be much smaller than the other. Default: TRUE}

\item{n.bootstraps}{number of bootstrap replicates. Relevant only if <use.bootstraps> is TRUE. Default: 10000}

\item{prob}{a numeric value >= 0 and <= 1; the minimum posterior probability required for an cell to be assigned to a mode. Default: 0.8}

\item{coverage}{the fraction of cells that must have a posterior probability higher than <prob> to one of two modes in order for the distribution to qualify as bimodal. Default: 0.8}

\item{verbose}{print progress messages. Default: TRUE}

\item{plot}{logical; scatter plot of cells' CNA correlations against CNA signal. This uses infercna::cnaScatterPlot. In order for the infercna::findMalignant function to be meaningful, expect two distinct groups of cells in the plot. Default: TRUE}

\item{...}{other arguments passed to infercna::fitBimodal.}
}
\value{
if bimodality was not found, returns FALSE. If bimodality was found, returns a list containing the malignant and non-malignant cell IDs.
}
\description{
Find the malignant and non-malignant subsets of cells from a gene-by-cell matrix of CNA values.
}
\details{
This function attempts to fit gaussian bimodal distributions to each of two parameters that describe the extent of CNAs per cell. The first of these is CNA correlation (infercna::cnaCor), which measures the pearson correlations between individual cells' CNA profiles and the average profile of their tumours of origin. The second measure is CNA signal (infercna::cnaSignal), which computes the cell averages of squared CNA values. The function then assigns cells residing in the 2nd (higher-value) mode by both measures as malignant, cells residing in the 1st (low-value) mode by both measures as non-malignant, and any remaining cells with conflicting assignments to modes as unassigned.
